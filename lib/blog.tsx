        <p>
          React Three Fiber is a React renderer for Three.js, making it possible to write 3D graphics with React's
          component-based approach. This powerful combination allows for declarative, reusable, and maintainable 3D
          scenes.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>First, install the necessary packages:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei</code>
        </pre>

        <p>Now you can create your first 3D scene:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>{`import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei'

function Box(props) {
  return (
    <mesh {...props}>
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color={'orange'} />
    </mesh>
  )
}

export default function Scene() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <spotLight position={[10, 10, 10]} angle={0.15} penumbra={1} />
      <Box position={[-1.2, 0, 0]} />
      <Box position={[1.2, 0, 0]} />
      <OrbitControls />
    </Canvas>
  )
}`}</code>
        </pre>

        <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
        <p>React Three Fiber offers many advanced features for creating complex 3D applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physics with use-cannon</li>
          <li>Post-processing effects</li>
          <li>Performance optimization</li>
          <li>Animation systems</li>
          <li>Loading 3D models</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          React Three Fiber opens up a world of possibilities for creating interactive 3D experiences on the web. By
          combining the power of Three.js with the simplicity of React, you can build complex 3D applications with ease.

    title: "Responsive Design Best Practices for Modern Web Applications",
    date: "2023-07-10",
    coverImage: "/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=800&text=Responsive+Design",
    excerpt:
      "Learn the essential techniques and best practices for creating responsive web designs that work across all devices.",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          Responsive web design is no longer optionalâ€”it's a necessity. With users accessing websites from a variety of
          devices with different screen sizes, creating a consistent and optimized experience across all platforms is
          crucial.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>Responsive design is built on three fundamental principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fluid Grids:</strong> Using relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixels
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexible Images:</strong> Ensuring images scale properly within their containers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Media Queries:</strong> Applying different styles based on device characteristics
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Modern Approaches</h2>
        <p>Today's responsive design goes beyond these basics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mobile-First Design:</strong> Starting with the mobile experience and progressively enhancing for
            larger screens
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS Grid and Flexbox:</strong> Using modern layout tools for complex, responsive layouts
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Container Queries:</strong> Styling based on the parent container's size rather than the viewport
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsive Typography:</strong> Using fluid type scales that adjust based on screen size
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Testing and Optimization</h2>
        <p>
          Always test your responsive designs on real devices. Browser developer tools are helpful, but nothing beats
          seeing how your site performs on actual hardware. Consider these testing approaches:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cross-device testing</li>
          <li>Performance testing on low-end devices</li>
          <li>Accessibility testing across breakpoints</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Responsive design is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. By following these best practices and
          continuously refining your approach, you can create web experiences that delight users across all devices.
