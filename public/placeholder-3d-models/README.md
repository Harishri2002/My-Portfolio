# Placeholder 3D Models

This directory contains simple placeholder 3D models that are used when the actual models are not available. These are intended for development and preview purposes only.

## Files

- `placeholder-astronaut.glb` - A simple humanoid figure for the Hero section
- `placeholder-workstation.glb` - A simple desk and monitor for the About section
- `placeholder-energy.glb` - A glowing sphere for the Contact section

## Usage

These models are automatically used as fallbacks in the Three.js components when the actual models cannot be loaded.
